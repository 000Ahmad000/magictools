Thanks for your interest on contributing to this repo
=====================================================

To keep things simple and organized, we need to keep some basic rules when adding new links:

1 - Make sure the link you are adding is not already added
2 - Make sure the link is relevant to this repo. We are focusing on game development here.
3 - Make sure the list you are adding is kept alphabetically ordered. This make it easier to find the links
4 - Be nice, be cool, and we will always love you!
